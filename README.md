# BBR Final Project Simulator
This simulator is a part of the final project for Brain, Body, and Robotics.

Here we simulate the stiffness ellipse for a three-jointed arm-like robot with a tendon-based articulation structure.

The aim of this simulator is to XXXX?

We support simulating the endpoint stiffness ellipse given arbitrary limb lengths and tendon stiffness parameters. We also support both bi-articular and mono-articular tendons, to show how these can affect endpoint stiffnesss.

### Running the Simulator

See the files run_simulator_*.sh for examples of running the code in mono-articular and bi-articular modes.

This project requires python, numpy, and opencv
